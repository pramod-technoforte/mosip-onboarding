## Partner Onboarding Utils

## Overview
This repository contains Postman collection to onboard partners on to MOSIP. 

* `run-onboard.sh`:  Onboard any partner.
* `default.sh`: Onboard default partners that are required to run a sandbox.  

## Docker
Docker to run `default.sh` is created to facilitate easy onboarding during installion. Refer `docker-build.sh` and `docker-run.sh`. Use this docker while installing MOSIP on Kubernetes. The docker runs an HTTP server to view the reports. Although this is a one-time job, the docker is run as Kubernetes Deployment with long sleep time set to review reports. If you restart the docker it will run the onboarding again.

The scripts assume a Keycloak client `mosip-deployment-client` with roles `GLOBAL_ADMIN`, `ID_AUTHENTICATION`, `PARTNER_ADMIN` is already created.
